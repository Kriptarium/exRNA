# exRNA Chaos Analyzer

This Streamlit app analyzes extracellular RNA (exRNA) time series data using Lyapunov exponents to detect chaotic dynamics.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Upload your own dataset or use the integrated large dataset to explore chaotic behavior in pathogen-host interactions.
